# Unhandled Exception in Scala Future's recover Method

This example demonstrates an uncommon error related to exception handling within Scala Futures.  Specifically, it shows how the `recover` method, when not used carefully, can mask exceptions and lead to unexpected program behavior.

The `BuggyFuture.scala` file contains code that uses `recover` to handle exceptions. However, it simply prints the error message and returns 0. This might not be the intended behavior. In scenarios where the result of the future is crucial, silently returning 0 could lead to data corruption or other issues.  A more robust solution is presented in `FixedFuture.scala`.

## How to Reproduce
1. Save the code in `BuggyFuture.scala`
2. Compile and run the code.
3. Observe that even when an exception is thrown (passing 0), the program continues and prints 0.  The exception is logged but not actually handled effectively.

## Solution
The `FixedFuture.scala` file demonstrates a better approach using `recoverWith`. This allows for returning a Future that is a replacement for the failed one. This avoids silently ignoring failures which is better for robust code.
